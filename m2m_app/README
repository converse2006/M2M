Run scenario step:
1.Edit your scenario (reference main.c) and modify topology.conf
based on your scenario 

2.Make application and use adb push into emulator
Usage: make clean; make; adb push vnd_api /data
Note: When push app into emulator, just run one emulator

3.Run many emulator as many as your device number
  and waiting for boot up

4.Execute application

Case 1: Ping Pong Test (demo01-pingpong)
Usage: ./data/vnd_api #DeviceNum
./push.sh   //Compile file and put execution file into dir /data
./data/vnd_api 1
./data/vnd_api 2
./data/vnd_api 3
./data/vnd_api 4

Case 2: JPEG picture transmission (demo02-filetrans)
Describe: Device2 tranfer lin.jpeg to Device1 and Device1 write to file out.jpeg
Hit: Use "adb -s emulator-5554 pull data/out.jpeg ." check data correct

./push.sh   //Compile file and put source jpeg file into device2 
            //and execution file to each device 
cd data;./vnd_api 1 lin.jpeg out.jpeg; cd ../
cd data;./vnd_api 2 lin.jpeg out.jpeg; cd ../
[Check] adb -s emulator-5554 pull /data/out.jpeg .
