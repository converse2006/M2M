If you can't run set_control panel, use this command line tool alternatively.

1.Put the set binary into emulator:
  host$ adb push set /data

2.Execute the set binary in emulator:
  emulator# cd data
  emulator# ./set -t <sum of event number> -m <timing model number> <process name>

  At the end of profiling
  emulator# ./set stop 

3.Event list:
  NO EVENT    - 1
  KERNEL      - 2
  SYSTEM CALL - 4
  LIBRARY     - 8
  USER C/C++  - 16
  DALVIK      - 32
  IRQ         - 64

4.Timing model list:
  GUESTTIME                            - 0
  PIPELINE                             - 1
  PIPELINE + CACHE                     - 2
  PIPELINE + CACHE + BRANCH PREDICTION - 3

5.Example:
  You can profiling the calculator in the emulator by the command below
  emulator# cd data
  emulator# ./set -t 43 -m 2 com.android.calculator2
  emulator# ./set stop
