1. Router time synchronization:
Even current earily packet time is small than router local time, the router still 
need to check other neighbor devices' local time, due to neighbor local time may not 
exceed the packet local time!!!

2.Send/Recv function time synchronization:
Check neighbor node local time  

3.Router only have one time which 
if packet exist
time is promote by packet
if no packet update by minimal neighbor local time

4.All neighbor need to wait util local time exceed packet time, even receiver!!

5.router need to identify who cause the local time (minimal time descirbe in 3.), and when it change, update the time
because other router may sync with you cause deadlock
